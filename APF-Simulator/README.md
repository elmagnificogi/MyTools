# APF-simulator 
## Introduction
The main idea behind artificial potential field methods is finding a function that represents the energy of the system,and generating a force on the robot so that the energy of the system is minimized and reach itâ€™s minimum value, preferably only, at the goal position.

This repository contains python,cpp,matlab simulator for APF

$ sudo pip install --upgrade pip 
$ sudo pip install --upgrade virtualenv 
```
Below Python packages are to be downloaded and installed to their default locations. 
- xlrd
>If not installed, execute the following command
>```sh
>$ pip install xlrd
>```
- opencv
>If not installed, refer [OpenCV Python  Installation](http://docs.opencv.org/2.4/doc/tutorials/introduction/linux_install/linux_install.html)
- numpy
>If not installed, execute the following command
>```sh
>$ pip install numpy
>```
To run the simulator, clone the repository and run the following commands
- python
```sh
$ cd APF-Simulator/PythonCode
$ python simulator.py
```
- cpp
>If Opencv not installed, refer [OpenCV C++ Installation](http://docs.opencv.org/2.4/doc/tutorials/introduction/linux_install/linux_install.html)
```sh
$ cd APF-Simulator/C++Code
$ make
$ ./bin
```
